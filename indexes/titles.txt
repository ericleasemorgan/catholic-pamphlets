    summary: A good question the sinner might ask himself before confessing his sins is: "Would my wife or husband, my best friend or roommate, recognize this confession as belonging to me?" Only by painful self-knowledge can a Christian liberate himself from the false view of his spiritual life that would judge his external acts according to a code of behavior.

    summary: "All work of Catholic reform," says Johannes Janssen, the great historian of this troublesome period, "which has had any permanence, owes its origin to the exertions of the first three Jesuits who labored in Germany, (Blessed) Peter Faber, Claudius Lejay, and Nicholas Bobadilla." (History of the German people, Vol. I l l , page 215.) They were natives of Savoy, France, and Spain respectively, which did not prevent them from pursuing their apostolate in Germany/The boundaries of nations and states did not yet divide Christendom in the same degree as now.

    summary: Laborthe work done by human beings-is the activity of one who comes from God and is destined some day to return to God. As Pope Pius XI said: "The wage contract is not to be condemned, it is not of its own nature vicious." But he continues: "It is a grave abuse when capital uses its power in such a way that it scorns the human dignity of the worker, the social character of economic activity and social justice itself and the common good." MONEY IS NECESSARY The Divine Plan regarding wages works out this way.

    summary: By ascribing unity to the essence of matrimony, we mean that monogamy, or the conjugal union of one man and one woman, is the only form of marriage that is conformable to the moral law established by Almighty God. It requires no lengthy process of reasoning to perceive that polygamy—whether it be polygyny (a plurality of wives wedded to one husband), or polyandry (a plurality of husbands wedded to one wife)—tends to subvert the domestic peace and to divide the conjugal love that are factors of such vital import to the marital state.

    summary: If we may reverently paraphrase the answer of Christ, it would read: "You must fulfill all those obligations which rightly fall upon you as a member of society while at the same time recognizing and fulfilling all those obligations which arise 8 THE COIN OF, OUR TRIBUTE from your individual existence as the creation of God." Now the whole modern difficulty arises from the failure to recognize that man is an individual as well as a member of the body politic.

    summary: "It is also a matter of: a kind of biological industrialization." Many branches of science and technology were coming together to provide the capacity to redefine what a human person is, to "create new norms of physical, intellectual, and psychological health." The bishops asserted that scientific and technical considerations "cannot provide the ultimate criteria for the construction of a society that is truly human." Nor can these criteria come from economic, social, and political concerns.

Jesus Christ, Our Lord, came to teach us 17 the truth, and for three years He taught His apostles and disciples.

    summary: There could not be a graver mistake ; the numerical strength of the Party has nothing to do with the case except this : that by keeping the official membership low, innocents among the opposition are thereby lulled into the belief that " communism doesn't count." THE COMMUNIST MENACE Those who base their indifference to communism on the comparative smallness of the Communist Party are playing directly into the hands of a movement which is planning for civil war, for the extermination of religion, and for the imposition by force of a soulless, materialistic régime on the whole nation.

    summary: But already there was not sufficient room for the numbers who assembled ; a second Oratory, therefore, that of St. Aloysius, was opened on December-8, 1847 (just six years since Don Bosco had picked up his first vagrant), and placed under the charge of the Abbé Borel ; the clergy of Turin, encouraged by their Archbishop, willingly assisting him, until the Oratory of St. Francis of Sales should have had time to train priests of its own for the work.

    summary: Chapter 22 of Genesis, to take another example, with its account of Abraham being ordered to sacrifice his son Isaac, is usually read as a case of exemplary obedience to the will of God. Seen against the 7 contemporary background that we have been describing, however, this story also appears as a highly theologized account which shows the development of Israel's conscience to the point where, under God's light, the nation realizes there should be no slaughter of the first-born.

    summary: How can you reasonably expect the Church to allow her children to become members of an organization where, although their Catholic faith is tolerated along with that of a Protestant or Jew or Pagan, it is nevertheless regarded as a corruption of that original truth which Freemasonry alone possesses in its purity according to the claims of its highest interpreters.

    summary: Formula of the Lateran Council "If anyone shall deny that all the faithful of both sexes, who have attained the use of reason are obliged to receive Communion every year, at least at Easter time, according to the precepts of holy Mother Church, let him be anathema." This formula and others like it coerce not the Catholic 4 FREQUENT COMMUNION FOR YOUNG AND OLD into believing, but rather give him cause to rejoice in the acquisition of certain truth: one of intellectual freedom's proudest faculties is the power of embracing heartily every undeniable proposition.

For this reason Holy Church specially attributes to Him all the works of grace and sanctification.

HATRED DIRECTED AGAINST THE CHURCH Let there be no doubt that this Satanic hatred is directed against the Church of Christ.

    summary: Upon analysis they are nothing more than unneutrality bills; bills which, if passed with all the provisions set down by Sol Bloom of the House of Representatives or with the provisions demanded by Key Pittman in the United States Senate, most certainly will force the United States and its citizens to commit themselves to a policy of war, of dictatorship and of final and complete government by man and not by law.

In Catholic schools of law and medicine the students are obliged to take a course in Catholic ethics, dealing both with Christian moral principles and, so far as possible, their application to practical cases.

There is so much that is admirable in all races: the family-love of Jewish people, the wit of the Irish, the thrift of the German, the solidity of the Scandanavian, the buoyant zest of the Latin, the "go-get" spirit of the American, the simplicity of the Slav and the placidity of the Oriental.

(Ps. 21:7) Mary gave Him birth and now she shares the longing of His broken Heart to suffer for mankind and for me.

    summary: Every German knows that the following sentence is thoroughly in accordance with the idiom of the German language : " So halten wir es nun, dass der Mensch nicht gerechtfertigt wird durch die "Werke des Gesetzes, sondern allein durch den Glauben." Now the only possible way of translating these words is : " So Ave now hold it, that man is not justified by the works of the law, but alone through faith." Nevertheless, "allein" has here exactly the same position with regard to the substantive " Glauben," as in Luther's text 4.

" In the Canon of the Mass, we speak not only of the sacrifice of praise but of the sacrifice of Abraham, and the priest says that "as many of us who, by participation at this altar, shall receive the most sacred Body and Blood of Thy Son, may be filled with every heavenly blessing and grace." The Canon-prayers between the Sanctus and the Pater Noster-provides an even greater harvest of thought, for it reveals the constant mind of the Church that when we celebrate Mass, we offer the Sacrifice of Jesus.

Furthermore: This direct aid given the persecuted Jews by the Pope in his capacity as bishop of Rome was the symbolic expression of an activity that was extended throughout the whole of Europe, encouraging and promotirg the efforts put forth by the Catholic churches in the majority of countries.

    summary: Our study turns especially towards the Church Militant, or what is usually called the Catholic Church, which may be defined as a society composed of all the faithful who profess the same Faith, use the same Sacraments, and pursue salvation under one common head, the Holy Father, who is the visible representative of Jesus Christ, the God-man who died for the salvation of all.

    summary: In virtue of these vows, not only is a Religious cut off from the world and incorporated or adopted into a spiritual family of his choice, but he becomes God's exclusive property by a new title distinct from that of creation and Redemption, namely, by a voluntary, unconditional and total donation of his whole being and his whole life, to be consumed like burning incense, in God's service and for His glory in any field of activity proper to his vocation.

    summary: Some seminaries have an established rate that is to be paid at specific times (an amount very much lower than is actually spent to feed, clothe, and educate you.) Others work out a special plan depending on the family's income; no young man will ever be denied entry because he has not the money to pay for his training!

    summary: Although the philosophy of Karl Marx is based on atheistic materialism, for that very reason its transformation into a religion, however inverted, demonstrates better than has ever been demonstrated in human history, that man is a "religious incurable." Some writers, notably Rev. William McDonald, in the American Ecclesiastical Review, have found remarkable parallels on the organizational hierarchial and theological planes between Communism and Catholicism.l Father McDonald notes that both call for the overcoming of the state of nature by a higher condition.
